Accessing Data with GORM
========================

*POC using GORM without rest of Grails.*

Code for [Accessing Data with GORM](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-gorm/) Getting Started Guide.

Implemented using locally installed *Groovy* and *Gradle* via GVM.

Build an executable JAR file:
-----------------------------
Just did `gradle build` without `gradlew`.

```
java -jar build/gs-accessing-data-gorm-0.1.0.jar
```

Test the application
--------------------
Used Chrome Advanced REST Client instead of `wget` because
*BlueCoat-Security-Appliance* blocked me.

Groovy Script Support
---------------------

Didn't do this part because really isn't applicable.
